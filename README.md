### Speech Markdown Preview

Speech Markdown outputs platform-compatible Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). Selecting Speech Markdown in an editor, right-clicking and selecting the "Speech Markdown to SSML" menu option provides SSML output for all supported platforms. At the time of this release (v0.0.8) this includes:

- Amazon Alexa
- Amazon Polly
- Amazon Polly Neural
- Microsoft Azure
- Samsung Bixby
- Google Assistant
- Plain Text

The resulting SSML is displayed in the Speech Markdown output channel.

For those that prefer keyboard shortcuts, use Ctrl+Shift+L.

By default, the starting and ending speak tags are included in the output. This can be disabled in Settings -> Extensions -> SpeechMarkdown -> Include Speak Tags. Here are the current configuration options:

### Speech Markdown Playback

Play SSML generated from Speech Markdown. Highlight and select Speech Markdown in the editor, right-click for a context menu and select either:

- Speak Selected SSML (Amazon Polly)
- Speak Selected SSML (Amazon Neural)

This will invoke the Amazon Polly API and play the generated MP3 file from your system's default MP3 player. In order to authenticate, you need an AWS account and your credentials:

#### Enable Intellisense in TypeScript and JavaScript

By default Visual Studio Code does not provide IntelliSense handling in strings. For more information, please see:

[TS/JS Path Quick Suggestion IntelliSense Does Not Work Unless QuickSuggestions.strings is enabled #23962](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/23962)

**NOTE:** IntelliSense in strings is _not_ available in JSON or YAML. If you wish to use Intellisense
in JSON files you can temporarily change the file extension to _js_.

If you wish to enabled IntelliSense in strings, then apply the following settings to your project folder.

1. Create a .vscode folder
2. Ad the following settings a new settings.json file:

```json
 "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "other": true,
    "comments": false,
    "strings": true
  }
```

Once configured, then IntelliSense works in JavaScript and TypeScript:
